				<p>&ldquo;Self-understanding requires unending negotiation and renegotiation of the meaning of your experiences to yourself. [...] It involves the constant construction of new coherences in your life, coherences that give new meaning to old experiences. The process of self-understanding is the continual development of new life stories for yourself.&rdquo; &mdash; George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By</p>
				<p>Hi! I'm Alexander Ocampo, but you can call me Alex. This website serves to document my life over the past few years, and how I've grown and changed as a person. Through a collection of art, photographs, journal entries, and present-day recounts of my past, I intend to cobble together some of the fond memories I have with myself so that I can look back, reflect, and move forward. Think of this as a scrapbook of sorts. As for why this website is interesting to <em>you</em> I can't quite say. Maybe you'll find some of my stories interesting, and maybe you'll empathize with some of the nostalgia this project gives me. But I hope, if anything, this reminds you to think about yourself and the selves you've been before, and perhaps inspire you to take a trip down memory lane.</p>
				<p>The title of this page is a bit deceptive&semi; you probably expected at least a little about who I actually am other than my name. But, everything else about me feels too variable to list as characteristic of all the me's built into this website. Just explore a bit and you'll probably learn more than you bargained for &colon;P</p>
				<p>As for a final bit of context as to why this kind of project means quite a bit to me&colon; my life has been kind of weird for the past few years. That's something you might discover as you navigate through these pages, but ultimately, I've been in a constant state of transition &lpar;in multiple senses&rpar; for perhaps six years now, rapidly changing between places and life contexts. Life happens fast!! Sometimes it feels like the person I was just a year ago is so different, just because the environment surrounding me was completely different. This website serves to question that and to ask how much has changed that's intrinsic to me, and how much is simply my circumstance. I don't know if I've come to any conclusions, but I've really enjoyed the process of exploring that.</p>
