			<h1>Questions of The Day</h1>
			<p>In August 2015, at the age of 12, I bought a book called &quot;Q&A a Day: 5-Year Journal&quot; with the intentions of writing my answer every day for the next five years. It's been seven years now, and with the amount of blank lines, the absolute earliest I could possibly fill in the whole book is May 2025. That&apos;s a whole decade later! I&apos;m desperately trying to be nice to my younger self but truly a lot of this book is kind of cringey. Still, I can&apos;t help but be fond of how my life slowly changed over these questions. Below is a selection of some of the questions that most depict who I've become over time.</p>

						<h2>January 25</h2>
						<p>What makes &quot;you&quot; you?</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2016.</strong> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know who I am, man
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>I guess that's what makes &quot;me&quot; me; indecisiveness.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2017.</strong> the inability to understand myself?
						<br>
						<br> i agree w/ last year, also i guess what makes me "me" is constantly imagining someone i'm not</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2018.</strong> &uarr; and also the unwantingness of wanting to know myself</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2020.</strong> &uarr; and still the need to discover myself against all odds.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2018.</strong> &amp; The right to define & redefine myself, while still never really changing at all.</p>

						<p><strong>2016.</strong> politics (it&apos;s election day)

						<br> I&apos;m not so much bored, but instead tired. I&apos;m an old &amp; jaded 14 y.o.</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2017.</strong> lowkey the entirety of tech comm</p>

						<br>
						<p><strong>2020.</strong> i&apos;m not bored but i&apos;m exhausted by politics. acutally bored of small-talking the people in the lounge</p>
						<br>
						<p><strong>2021.</strong> honestly i just need to find ANY new content to talk to myself about. being alone isn&apos;t lonely yet but i&apos;m kinda boring sometimes</p>
