			<h1>Portrait Timeline</h1>
			<p>Whenever I don't know what to draw, I usually default to drawing myself. As vain as that is, I've always seen myself as a reference that's always readily available. And, as the years have gone by, I can step back and watch as my view of myself has changed. Click on any of the portraits to learn more about me at the time of each portrait's creation!</p>

					<p>This was finished near the end of my second year at Bard College at Simon's Rock. And if you think the math in this timeline doesn't add up, it's because it doesn't.</p>
