			<h1>Portrait Timeline</h1>
			<p>Whenever I don't know what to draw, I usually default to drawing myself. As vain as that is, I've always seen myself as a reference that's always readily available. And, as the years have gone by, I can step back and watch as my view of myself has changed. Click on any of the portraits to learn more about me at the time of each portrait's creation!</p>
