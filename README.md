To access my website, start at ~/docs/index.html and everything else should be accessible from there.

In lieu of my about page writing, you should know that this website's goal is to document my life and how I've changed over the years. I think of it like a scrapbook more than anything. My website is still very much a work in progress. My main concerns are the layout/positioning of each piece of content in the website. Is it easy to navigate, and does your eye follow down the page in a natural way? Alongside the actual write-ups for image descriptions and the about page, my next main goal is to make the website actually look nice (with the first step of styling the navigation bar). The color pallete will generally stay the same, but IMO the edges all feel a bit harsh and not very cohesive right now.
