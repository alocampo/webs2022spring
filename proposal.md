I want to create a portfolio skewing more into the artful than the resourceful, creating more of a portfolio of myself than my work (despite how absolutely pretentious that sounds). My inspiration draws incredibly heavily from [my body: a Wunderkammer](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/jackson__my_body_a_wunderkammer/index.html) except I want to take parts of this concept and restructure them to be formatted like a typical website.  The central function is to examine the idea of "coming of age" within my life's context. As such I'll be utilizing creative works and pieces of media I've made throughout my life and hopefully juxtapose them in a way that creates a dialogue.

The website itself will have five pages: a landing page, an about page, a portrait portfolio page, a QoTD page, and a last page I'm not set on yet. The landing page will have the title of the project (currently unnamed), my name, a brief description of the website, and larger icons to navigate to the actual content of the website. The about page will have a lengthier description about the website and why I made it, as well as chow my contacts at the bottom. The Question of the Day page will allow viewers to click on a month in the side panel and show one question of the day that I answered that month. For context, since 2015 I've had a book that asks a question a day, and on most days for the past 7 years I've answered the question for the day. For accessibility, there will be a toggle somewhere on the website to switch between an original scan of the page and a typed-out version. The portraits page will have a timeline (thinking about moving it to the top instead of bottom of the page) that when clicked, will show a self-portrait I made around that time, a real picture of me from around that time, and a brief bit of prose about what my life was like around then.

A big problem arising with this concept is trying to abstract this work for a larger audience; if you don't know me, why do you care? How will this website be useful to other people? I suppose you could ask that question when anyone uses any medium to make something as an expression, but in this context it feels much more pressing because of our understanding of what websites are/what websites are for.
