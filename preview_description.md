At the moment, my goal while working on my website is outlining all the containers and flex boxes necessary to actual put content in. All of my CSS is simple coding to be able to see if the containers are grouping properly and every image is one of the base images from the tutorial. I've found that a lot of my conceptions from the beginning of this website are somewhat unrealistic for the scope of the assignment, so I've been thinking about how I might pull back on the interactivity while not becoming overbearing in how much content I'm throwing everything at the viewer all at once.

As I'm adjusting to writing in HTML and CSS, I'm realizing that the core pages in my website are all the same format but containing different pieces of content. Before I continue to add onto the writing I have, I should take a step back and re-work on paper how I can generalize the coding for the classes so that I can just reuse them instead of having to create new classes with essentially the same CSS formatting over and over. After that, I should do some of the more basic parts of the CSS formatting before stepping back from the website for a moment to actually gather the contents I will be posting onto it.
