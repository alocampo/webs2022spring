At the moment, my goal while working on my website is outlining all the containers and flexboxes necessary to actually put content in. My stylesheet's sole purpose right now is to be able to see if the containers are grouping properly, so the aesthetics are leaving much to be desired. Every image is also one of the assets from the tutorial for the same reason. I've found that a lot of my conceptions from the beginning of this website are somewhat unrealistic for the scope of the assignment, so I've been thinking about how I might pull back on the interactivity while not becoming overbearing in how much content I'm throwing at the viewer all at once.

As I'm adjusting to writing in HTML and CSS, I'm realizing that the core pages in my website are all the same format but containing different pieces of content. Before I continue to add onto the scripting I have, I should take a step back and re-work on paper how I can generalize the classes so that I can just reuse them instead of having to create new classes with essentially the same CSS formatting over and over. After that, I should do some of the more basic parts of the CSS formatting before stepping back from the website for a moment to actually gather the contents I will be posting onto it.
